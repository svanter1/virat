                To the world we serve, <br><br>

            Amigo Jets is such an iconic brand that over many decades we've come to occupy an important place in the lives of our employees and customers.
            The very name Amigos has a way of evoking strong memories and an uncanny power to set a person to humming the opening bars of "Rhapsody in Blue" without even noticing it.
            Perhaps you flew with us to reach a child's graduation or wedding.<br><br>
            Maybe you trusted us to get you to that big job interview on time, or to embark on new adventures, or to reunite with old friends.
            We've been there for you during the daily grind of business trips, and I hope we've made those countless miles seem more comfortable and productive.
            Like you, I've enjoyed a long association with Amigos. For us, the name Amigos evokes something special.
            It brings to mind the countless inspiring stories of so many dedicated professionals I've met.
            Each day, they make me proud to call myself a member of their team.<br><br>
            I see our people going the extra mile for our customers and for one another.
            I see them brave the elements and endure the long hours and late nights, often far away from their homes.
            I see them strive to go beyond expectations and deliver a better experience for our customers with each flight.
            This is the vision of our company that I find most inspiring.<br><br>
            In order to find out what the rest of my colleagues felt most inspired by, we conducted interviews and gathered thousands of viewpoints from people across our system.
            The result is our company's first-ever statement of Shared Purpose and Values.
            It will serve as the touchstone of our efforts and the benchmark of our progress as we strive to create the best airline in the world for you.
